        <p>In a tale of longing and magic, a couple desperately wishing for a child peers into an enchantress's garden, where the wife craves rampion. To satisfy her, the husband steals from the garden, but is caught by the enchantress. In exchange for the rampion, they must give their unborn child to her. The child, named Rapunzel, grows up to be stunningly beautiful, and is locked in a tower by the enchantress. The only entry is by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair when she lowers it upon hearing the call:

            "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
            Let down your hair to me."
            
            A prince hears Rapunzel's singing and learns to ascend the tower using her hair. They fall in love and plan her escape. However, the enchantress discovers their plan, cuts off Rapunzel's hair, and banishes her. When the prince returns, he's tricked by the enchantress, falls from the tower, and becomes blind. Wandering for years, he finally reunites with Rapunzel and their twins. Her tears restore his sight, leading to a joyous return to his kingdom, where they live happily ever after.</p>
