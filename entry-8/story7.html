Once upon a time, there lived a poor miller who had a daughter of extraordinary beauty. Eager to impress the king, the miller falsely boasted of his daughter's remarkable talent for spinning
straw into gold. The king, intrigued by the prospect, summoned the miller to his palace and told him, "If your daughter possesses such a gift as you claim, bring her to my palace tomorrow, 
and I will put her to the test."
The next day, the miller presented his daughter to the king. The king led her into a room brimming with straw, handed her a spinning wheel and a reel, and said, "Now, set to work. If by 
tomorrow morning you have not spun all this straw into gold, or you must die."
The girl, overwhelmed and afraid, was locked in the room with the daunting task. She had no idea how to accomplish this impossible feat and began to weep. Suddenly, a little man appeared
and asked, "Why are you crying, dear miller's daughter?"

She replied, "I'm supposed to spin straw into gold, and I have no idea how to do it."
The little man inquired, "What will you give me if I spin it for you?"
The girl hesitated for a moment but eventually offered her necklace. The little man accepted the necklace, sat down at the spinning wheel, and magically spun the straw into gold.

By morning, the king was astounded to find the room filled with gleaming gold. However, his greed knew no bounds. He took the miller's daughter to an even larger room filled with
an immense amount of straw, declaring that she must spin it all into gold by morning if she wanted to be his queen.
The girl, feeling helpless, was once again visited by the little man. This time, she offered her ring in exchange for his assistance, and once more, he performed his magic,
turning the straw into gold.
Impressed but still unsatisfied, the king presented another challenge. He placed the girl in a room with an enormous quantity of straw and promised to marry her if she could spin it all
into gold in one night.

Alone and despairing, the girl faced a dilemma. The little man returned for the third time and asked, "What will you give me if I help you with this final task?"
The girl replied, "I have nothing left to give."
The little man proposed a unique condition: "Promise me your first child if you become queen."
The girl, uncertain about her future, agreed to the deal. The little man, true to his word, spun the straw into gold.

When the king saw the gold, he married the miller's daughter, and she became queen. Time passed, and she gave birth to a beautiful child. She had nearly forgotten her promise to the 
little man when, unexpectedly, he reappeared and demanded the child as agreed.
The queen was frantic and offered the little man all the riches in the kingdom. But he refused, saying, "Something living is more precious to me than all the world's treasures."
Desperate, the queen had three days to guess the little man's name. She sent messengers far and wide and heard a peculiar name mentioned by a stranger near the forest's edge, 
"Rumpelstiltskin."

You may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, "Now, mistress queen, what is my name?"
At first she said, "Is your name Conrad?"
"No."
"Is your name Harry?"
"No."
"Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?"

"The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that," cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in,
and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.
