        <!-- <p>Fairytales. Hopefully this single word will be able to trigger a tender feeling in you. For me, fairytales became a structure in my childhood, something I would read for “fun”and keeps me at peace. Conceptually, I think of it as an old tree, rooted deep into people. And through the trunk it grows, travels and disperses into branches and leaves passing on thousands of stories and hundreds of variations creating a life for itself. Storytelling and being immersive is an important aspect of fairytale, to keep the readers inside the story empowering them to visualize. Not only that but to motivate young readers once they rethink about the story for example… people face different obstacles, but if they believe in themselves, they can always overcome it. Moral of the story. Fairytales create a message within itself to expose people to different lessons. Different cultures passes down different stories, for my theme I wanted to explore fairytales that I read as a child. Allowing my harmonic collection to shed light on stories from a different culture while also analyzing the meanings behind them. The envision of my harmonic collection is to incorporate my idea of the tree as collection of the fairytales to be told.
